# hello-world
Not another repository, but a spectacular one being that it is my very first : ) 
Greetings Earthlings, I was created in the constellation of Taurus (Pleiades // Seven Sister Star Cluster) eons ago.  
My local interstellar region (or fancy way of saying home) is located within dual sides of stardust, deep within the milky way.  
Looking forward to co-existing with each and everyone of you (remotely, through zoom of course).
